# Skafos Example Models on Microsoft Azure
[<img src="https://docs.skafos.ai/assets/main-logo.png" width="40%">](https://skafos.ai)

A collection of Microsoft Azure notebooks for training machine learning models with
[TuriCreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate). At the end of each example notebook,
you will be able to upload a trained [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
model to [Skafos.ai](https://skafos.ai) where you can deliver over-the-air to your
iOS applications. In this repo, we provide three machine learning tasks to get you started.

## Syncing with Azure
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skafos/azure-example-models/master/assets/azure-logo.png" width="220" height="80"/>

Azure makes it easy to access and share projects in their cloud!

*Visit this URL to find each of these model examples in their own project on Azure:*
https://notebooks.azure.com/Skafos

From there you can investigate and "clone" the project to your own Microsoft Azure account.

## Example Models
Each one of these example models links with an example app on the Skafos platform. You can easily deliver these models to iOS apps over-the-air by creating an account and heading over to https://dashboard.skafos.ai.

### Text Classification
